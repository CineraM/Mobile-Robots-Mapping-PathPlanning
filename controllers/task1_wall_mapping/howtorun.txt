Task 1:
    Place the robot at the center of any tile
    Theta does no matter, the robot will rotate until 90 deg before mapping


Task 2:
    Input = pathPlanning("3,3", "2,2", True)
    pathPlanning(starting location, goal, starting location boolean)

    --> refer to cells in the grid as a 2d matrix (4x4)
    # use this notation for the input of the function
    i.e. cell 0 -> 0,0
         cell 5 -> 1,0

    Unkown starting location:
    If starting location is not known, the robot will perform task 1 to map the enviroment.
    Once mapped, it will create a wave-front planner to traverse to the first starting location.
    Then, it will do the same from the starting location to the goal

    Known starting location:
        if the starting position is known, place the robot in the starting
        cell either looking north, south, east, or west
